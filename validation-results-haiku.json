      "feedback": "The transformation subtly removes the negative 'ugh' while preserving the enthusiastic sentiment about the running influencer. The added exclamation point maintains the commenter's excited tone. The core message remains unchanged, and it sounds like the original commenter just removed a slight negative preface. The only minor improvement could be ensuring the removal of 'ugh' doesn't lose any nuanced emotion."
