# Project Status Update

Read the sessions.md file and git status to give me a quick recap of:

1. **Where I left off** - What was I working on last session?
2. **Current branch** - What branch am I on and what's its purpose?
3. **Uncommitted changes** - What files are modified/staged?
4. **Next steps** - What should I do next to continue?

Keep the recap concise and actionable - bullet points are great.

If there are immediate blockers or things I need to test, highlight those first.
